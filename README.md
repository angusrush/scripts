## Scripts
This repository contains scripts that I use frequently, mostly written in broken bash and python
* `edittex` edits whatever .tex files are in the working directory
* `enabletapping` turns turns on the touchpad
* `pullall` Pulls all my git repos
* `screenlocker` pixelates the screen, then runs i3lock
* `server-compile` compiles a latex document on my home server
* `synctb` backs up my textbook collection to my home server
* `togglecursoor` moves the cursor to the bottom right corner of the screen, then back
* `togglenightmode` dims the screen fully, then brightens it again
* `toggletouchpad` turns the touchpad on and off
